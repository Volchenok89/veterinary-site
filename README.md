## Description

This web application will allow people to check in online for a Vet's visit and describe their pet's symptoms. 
Pet owners can also go to the pharmacy site and checkout products.
They can navigate trough the site and check services page.

Then, if there is a simple treatment, it will avoid a long trip to the vet's office.

Doctors can simply prescribe medication requests made by users. They can also answer messages from their patient parent's, 
and will be able to change the status of a patient's visit.
